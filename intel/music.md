Geno occasionally keeps up with his exâ€™s music interests. What do they say about her personality?

Author: Brendy

# Solution
Recalled when we solved the [Finding Geno](geno.md), we were presented with a link to his
personal website where we found a link to his social media sites include
spotify. By visiting Geno's profile, we were able to visit his ex's 
profile. However upon creating an account, we were able to see her playlist
which contain the flag by taking the first letter of each songs.

As one see, the description was a bit misleading in the challenge. However,
it was understandble as to why the author didnt said horoscope sign as oppose to
sign in general. Most would have bruteforce the 12 signs... haha
