# Solution
This challenge was about how sometime sensitive things get pushed to production and even if the file might have been
removed, it might still be in the git log history

```git log -p -2``` will show a list of commit history along with some summary of what was change

When we checked out the first commit, we saw a flag.txt and was greeted with 'Your princess is in another castle' so we decided
to checkout the latest commit but the flag.txt was empty. At this point, it was lot of googling to understand how git store files
and where the histories are stored. After much reading, it was found that .git often store the history in [.git/objects](https://aboullaite.me/deep-dive-into-git/) and I was able to create
a script that retrieve the flag using python

```
from hashlib import sha1
import zlib
decompressed = zlib.decompress(open('.git/objects/01/3a6dddd6001f9401061e56118fe417015d1b4c','rb').read())
print decompressed
print sha1(decompressed).hexdigest()
```

and I was able to get the hash that I need to check out and obtain the flag
