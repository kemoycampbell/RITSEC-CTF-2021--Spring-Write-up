# Solution
For this particular challenge, we are given a PDF with the flag redacted (blackout). I open the PDF and attempt
to copy and paste to notepad because sometime those work on unproper redacted. However, it didnt work so I moved on to 
step 2. I clicked on the picture in the pdf and right click saved as image. Upon open the pdf, the flag was visible 
:-)
